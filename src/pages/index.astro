          I love coding ever since I was a young boy, I always loved to build
          things that others can enjoy, software that make their life better, be
          it because made them laugh, because they had fun using it or just
          because it automated away that awfull boring task.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was because of this passion for technology and its potential that I
          decided to make software development my life's work, my legacy to this
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I have more than 10 years of experience working professionally
          in this area and had the opportunity to utilize a vast variety of
          tecnologies, like React, TypeScript, GraphQL, Next.js, Node.js,
          Express, MongoDB, Docker, .Net Core, SQL Server and etc. I'm a natural
          self-learner, eager to explore new tecnologies and put this knowledge
          to use, solving problems and help clients to improve his day-to-day
          lifes
